# SJ-Rescue

Real World Project ~ reworking a local animal shelter website. Aiming to improve the overall UI / UX of the site, adding accessibility features, and modernizing the information architecture

# Purpose

SJ Rescue is a local non-profit animal shelter. They rescue strays, provide necessary medical care, and rehome animals. While their website provides the basic information someone might be looking for, its tedious and frustrating to navigate due to overwhelming information and small / difficult to see elements.

My goal is to redesign their website so that it feels more comfortable navigating, reduce confusion, and make the environment more welcoming to users.
