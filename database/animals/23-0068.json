The sweetest most playful 4 months old kitten. Although he has tested positive with FIV, do not look him over! He can live a normal life! He is so playful and such a love bug. He also gets along with non-aggressive dogs, and always loves to be in your space. Someone, please give him a chance! The virus antibodies were passed on to him from his mother & none of his others siblings have the virus. In six months he can be retested again and more than likely it will show no signs of the virus. Please have it in your heart to give him a chance to find his furever home!"}
